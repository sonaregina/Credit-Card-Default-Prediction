# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a credit card user will default on their payment based on customer and transaction data. Using classification models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, the project evaluates performance through various metrics and handles imbalanced data.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Credit card default is a common problem faced by financial institutions. By predicting the likelihood of default, institutions can take preventive actions to manage risk.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Classification Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC
- Handling Imbalanced Data: Resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE)

## 📁 Dataset
A publicly available dataset (e.g., UCI Credit Card Default) was used, containing features such as:
- Credit limit
- Payment history
- Bill amount
- Demographics

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. **Feature Engineering** to enhance model performance
3. **Model Training** using Random Forest
4. **Evaluation** using metrics suited for imbalanced classification tasks

## 📈 Results
- The best model achieved an AUC-ROC score of XX (update with your score)
- Precision and recall were balanced to minimize false positives/negatives
